            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Me: hey, how are going?<br><br>ChatGPT: Hello! As an AI language model, I don't have feelings or emotions, but I'm functioning as intended and ready to assist you with any questions or tasks you may have. How can I help you today?<br><br>Me: I have facing a personal problem. I have a best friend who wss girl. In a yar ago, she got marrid. after marrid she never talk with me. I love her. In the past, me and she all the the time talking with phone call. Now, I missing her so much. I am crying for her. I trying to talk with her. but she ignore me. she alwase talk with her husband. how can I do now? I am so sad for that.<br><br>ChatGPT: I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time. It can be tough when relationships change, especially when it's someone you care about. Here are some steps you can take to help you cope with this situation:<br><br>    Accept the situation: It's important to acknowledge that your friend's priorities may have shifted since getting married. She may be busy with her new life, and that might mean that she doesn't have as much time for you as she used to. It can be hard to accept that things have changed, but it's a necessary step in moving forward.<br><br>    Communicate your feelings: It's okay to tell your friend how you feel, but make sure you do it in a respectful way. Let her know that you miss her and that you value your friendship. Be honest about your feelings, but also be prepared to listen to her perspective.<br><br>    Give her space: While it's important to communicate your feelings, it's also important to respect her boundaries. If she's not interested in talking to you right now, give her some space. It may be that she needs time to adjust to her new life, and that she'll come back to you when she's ready.<br><br>    Focus on yourself: While it's natural to miss your friend, it's important to focus on your own life as well. Take some time to do things that you enjoy, whether that's spending time with other friends, pursuing a hobby, or just taking some time for yourself. Remember that you are important too.<br><br>    Seek support: It can be helpful to talk to someone about how you're feeling, whether that's a trusted friend, family member, or a therapist. They can offer you support and guidance as you navigate this difficult situation.<br><br>I hope these suggestions are helpful to you. Remember that it's okay to feel sad, but also remember that you are strong and capable of getting through this.<br><br>Me: when I miss her, I just cry. and I am introvert person. I am introvert from my childhood. I cannot live without her. but she ignore me, becoz she dont want me. she just want to forget me. but I love her. when she getting married, I am trying to died. but I cannot this. now, I am not try to died, but how sad I am, that anyone cannot fill it. at this time, I am crying. she live in my local area. but I dont want to see her. becouse I love her. I have not enogh word, that I explain how sad I am.<br><br>ChatGPT: I understand that this is a very difficult and painful situation for you. It can be very hard to come to terms with the fact that someone you care about may not feel the same way about you. It's okay to feel sad and to cry - it's a natural way to express your emotions.<br><br>It's important to remember that you can't force someone to have feelings for you or to be your friend. As much as it hurts, you need to respect your friend's decision and give her space. It's okay to take time to grieve the loss of the friendship, but it's also important to start focusing on yourself and your own well-being.<br><br>If you're finding it difficult to cope with your feelings, it might be helpful to speak to a therapist or a counselor. They can offer you support and guidance on how to manage your emotions and work through your feelings of sadness and loss.<br><br>Remember that you are not alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to support you through this difficult time.\n  </p>",
